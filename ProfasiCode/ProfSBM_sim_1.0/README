To compile ProFASi, type

make CC=g++/icc/xlC/pgCC
make CC=g++/icc/xlC/pgCC parallel
make install

Chose one of the 4 compilers for the "CC=__" option passed to make. Use the same
compiler for the compilation of the parallel part.

To compile a debugging version, you should pass the additional option 
BUILDTYPE=debug to the make commands above. The debugging and optimized versions
can exist side by side. The object files are written in separate directories and
the executables are given special extensions (".dbg" or ".mdb") for the debugging
versions.

To compile a local version of the documentation (you should definitely do this!)
type,

make docs

The documentation is built into the directory doc/html/ inside ProFASi's main
directory.

The "make install" only creates bin and include subdirectories inside the
directory installs. You don't need administrator priviledges for it. It creates some
symbolic links useful for compilation of external programs using the ProFASi
library, and puts the executables in a place where they are not touched until
you run make install again.

If git is the version control system for PROFASI, "make install" creates a
sub-directory with the name of the active git branch, and installs the binaries
and headers into that directory. So, if you want to switch to a new branch and
want to compare the results of the executables generated with the new branch
and the old branch, you should run "make install" in the old branch before
changing branch.
