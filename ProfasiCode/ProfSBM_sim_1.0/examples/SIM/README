Set up real simulations for some simple systems. Here we have
examples of a single chain system, and a multi-chain system.
Observe the contents of the settings files and the other 
files provided in these directories. No make file is needed.
The programs to run can be found in the app directory, and
are compiled with the rest of PROFASI.
