This is a simple program that prints Gaussian random numbers to the standard output.
The mean and standard deviation can be controlled by command line parameters.

This is about as simple an example as one can construct illustrating how some 
classes of PROFASI might be used to make an application doing something sensible. 
It illustrates the use of ProgUtils class that is used across most PROFASI applications
to handle command line arguments. 

To compile, type "make". If you have compiled PROFASI with a different compiler than 
g++, type "make CC=that_compiler" instead. 

Type the name of the generated executable file, ran_example.ex, to get some usage 
information.
