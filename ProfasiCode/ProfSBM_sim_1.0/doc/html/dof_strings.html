<h1><a class="anchor" id="dof_strings">ProFASi DOF identifier strings </a></h1><h2><a class="anchor" id="specs">
Specification</a></h2>
<p>ProFASi uses the following syntax to label a degree of freedom:</p>
<ul>
<li>A DOF string has 4 fields, separated by the ':' character </li>
<li>A DOF string contains no spaces </li>
<li>The first field is the chain number, an integer starting from 0 </li>
<li>The second field is the residue number, an integer starting from 0. In case there are N- or C-terminal capping groups for a chain, they are counted as residues. </li>
<li>The third field is a type specifier for the DOF. Following values are possible: <ul>
<li>
"rigid_body_xyz" or "rigid" or "r" or "0" </li>
<li>
"backbone_torsional_angle" or "backbone" or "b" or "1" </li>
<li>
"sidechain_torsional_angle" or "sidechain" or "s" or "2" </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The last field is an index which changes meaning depending on the other fields. It represents the serial number of a DOF in the context defined by the other fields. </li>
<li>The chain, residue and type fields may or may not be given. The index field is compulsory. </li>
<li>If the type field is given, the index field refers to a serial number of the DOF within its own type. "43rd backbone DOF" etc. Otherwise, the index field refers to a serial number for the DOF in a list of all kinds of DOF. </li>
<li>If the chain field is empty, the residue field as well as the index field is interpreted relative to the whole system. </li>
<li>If the chain field is given, but residue field is empty, the index is interpreted as the serial number in the given chain starting from the beginning of the chain. </li>
<li>If both chain and residue fields are given, the residue field is interpreted within that chain. The index is local to the residue and within the type of the DOF. </li>
<li>It is not allowed to specify the residue field but not specify the DOF type.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="examples">
Examples</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>:::22</b> is the 23rd degree of freedom in the whole population. The chain, residue and type fields are not specified. Therefore the index 23 has the widest possible context. </li>
<li><b>: :b:22</b> is the 23rd backbone degree of freedom counting all chains. The type of the DOF is specified, but the chain and residue are not given. So, the context is "all backbone degrees of freedom in the system". </li>
<li><b>3:::22</b> is the 23rd degree of freedom in the 4'th chain (indices start from 0). </li>
<li><b>3: :s:7</b> is the 8th side chain degree of freedom in the 4'th chain </li>
<li><b>:41:s:2</b> is the 3rd side chain DOF of the 42nd residue in the whole system. N- and C-terminal capping groups count as residues. The residue index is relative to the whole system. </li>
<li><b>0:12:s:2</b> is the 3rd side chain DOF of the 13th residue of the first chain. Notice that whenever the residue field is specified, the type field is also specified. This is a requirement. </li>
</ul>
