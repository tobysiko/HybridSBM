<h1><a class="anchor" id="tutorial_3">Tutorial 3: Simulated annealing </a></h1><p>In simulated annealing, the temperature for the canonical Monte Carlo run is gradually lowered, starting from some high temperature. We illustrate simulated annealing in PROFASI and its peculiarities by taking an <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\alpha$" src="form_10.png"/>-helical mini-protein: the Tryptophan cage 1L2Y. Instead of <a class="el" href="classBasicMCRun.html" title="Constant temperature Monte Carlo simulations.">BasicMCRun</a>, we now run <a class="el" href="classSimAnnealRun.html" title="Simulated annealing.">SimAnnealRun</a>: <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
prompt&gt; $profasi_dir/bin/SimAnnealRun -ac 1 "*NLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS*" \
-ncyc 20000 -nrt 500 -tmax "374 Kelvin" -tmin "274 Kelvin" -ntmp 10 -ncT 1000
</pre></div><p>First, notice that the usage is very similar to that of <a class="el" href="classBasicMCRun.html" title="Constant temperature Monte Carlo simulations.">BasicMCRun</a>. This is the case with all simulation programs in PROFASI. Technically, <a class="el" href="classSimAnnealRun.html" title="Simulated annealing.">SimAnnealRun</a>, <a class="el" href="classSimTempRun.html" title="Simulated tempering with profasi.">SimTempRun</a>, <a class="el" href="classParTempRun.html" title="Parallel tempering class.">ParTempRun</a> and <a class="el" href="classWLRun.html" title="Monte Carlo simulations with the Wang Landau method.">WLRun</a> inherit from <a class="el" href="classBasicMCRun.html" title="Constant temperature Monte Carlo simulations.">BasicMCRun</a>. So, their interfaces will seem similar. Some options for <a class="el" href="classBasicMCRun.html" title="Constant temperature Monte Carlo simulations.">BasicMCRun</a>, like the <em>--add_chains</em> option, make perfect sense here, and are simply inheritted from <a class="el" href="classBasicMCRun.html" title="Constant temperature Monte Carlo simulations.">BasicMCRun</a>. Some options, like <em>--temperature</em> make no sense here and are therefore ignored. Notice that in the above, we use options <em>-tmax</em> and <em>-tmin</em> to set a range of temperatures instead of specifying one temperature. <em>-ntmp</em> means the number of temperatures going from the maximum to the minimum. The option <em>ncT</em> specifies how many Monte Carlo cycles are to be performed at each temperature. The temperatures are lowered by a constant factor every ncT Monte Carlo sweeps so that we go from 374 K to 274 K in 9 changes. You can of course choose to have ncT=1 and 100000 temperatures in your simulation, although this is not recommended as the averages will be printed for all temperatures in the simulation, leading to some huge output files.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tutorial_3_output">
Output files</a></h2>
<p>Now, let's examine the output of the program. On the standard output, the simulated annealing program writes down what temperature values are used, how many Monte Carlo sweeps are performed at each temperature, and the probability for various conformational updates to be used at each temperature. Now, open the run-time history file, rt. You will notice that the second column, which always used to be 0 for the <a class="el" href="classBasicMCRun.html" title="Constant temperature Monte Carlo simulations.">BasicMCRun</a> examples, now has non-zero values. The value in this column is the "temperature index", and indicates which temperature the system is at, at a certain MC time. The actual temperature can be looked up in the standard output list of temperatures, as mentioned above, or in a special file called <em>temperature.info</em> in the output directory. If you plot the column 2 of rt vs column 1, you should see a saw-tooth pattern. The index increases linearly from 0 to it's maximum value (the number of temperatures-1), and then goes to 0. Since PROFASI orders temperatures by <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T} $" src="form_11.png"/>, increasing temperature indices normally correspond to decreasing temperatures.</p>
<p>The "averages" file, which contained a single row of values for each measurement in <a class="el" href="classBasicMCRun.html" title="Constant temperature Monte Carlo simulations.">BasicMCRun</a>, now has several rows for each measurement, one for each temperature. The values are listed according to the temperature-index.</p>
<p>Histograms are turned off by default for simulated annealing in PROFASI although you can enable them by run by doing both of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the option <em>--histograms</em> on the command line </li>
<li>put the number of thermalisation cycles to 0 with <em>-ntherm</em> <em>0</em>, as the program does not send any data to the histograms until the designated number of thermalisation cycles are finished. Since simulated annealing spends a pre-determined number of cycles at each temperature, it is better to set ntherm to 0 and have the same number of points for each temperature.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do the above, you will notice that the generated histogram files look different and have many columns. The first column is the value of the observable in question, say x, and the subsequent columns are the dP/dx values at temperature indexes 0, 1, 2, 3 ... Each histogram file contains data for all temperatures. (Yet another thing to consider if you want to do simulated annealing with 100000 temperatures!) The reader will learn more about PROFASI's histograms in subsequent tutorials on simulated and parallel tempering.</p>
<p>Most other output files have similar meanings in <a class="el" href="classSimAnnealRun.html" title="Simulated annealing.">SimAnnealRun</a> as in <a class="el" href="classBasicMCRun.html" title="Constant temperature Monte Carlo simulations.">BasicMCRun</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tutorial_3_finegrained">
Schema files: fine grained control over temperature decrease</a></h2>
<p>It has often been suggested that it is a waste of computation time to have as many MC cycles at the highest temperatures of simulated annealing as at the lowest temperatures. This is not the place for us to argue in favour or against such a claim. But we provide facilities in PROFASI to use virtually any scheme for lowering temperatures in simulated annealing. This is done with a "schema" file for simulated annealing. The following is an example schema file: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
#temperature Kelvin
400 100
350 120
330 500
320 1000
315 3000
310 1000
300 1000
290 1000
280 1000
270 1000
</pre></div><p> The first line tells the program that the temperature values are in Kelvin. Alternatives would be "#temperature inverted" if you choose to input <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T} $" src="form_11.png"/> values, or you omit the "#temperature ___" line altogether so that the temperature values will be assumed to be in internal PROFASI units. The remaining lines are interpreted as ordered pairs with a temperature and the number of sweeps at that temperature. So, using this schema, the simulated annealing program will spend only 100 sweeps at the highest temperature, 120 at 350 K, ... To use this scheme of lowering temperatures, save the above example schema file (say, as abcd.sas), and invoke the <a class="el" href="classSimAnnealRun.html" title="Simulated annealing.">SimAnnealRun</a> as,</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
prompt&gt; $profasi_dir/bin/SimAnnealRun -ac 1 "*NLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS*" -ncyc 20000 -nrt 500 --schema_file abcd.sas
</pre></div><p>In case you use such a schema file, options tmin, tmax, ntmp and ncT are ignored. All such information can be inferred from the schema file.</p>
<p>You can also run the simulated annealing program without these command line options, but with a settings file like the following:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
log_level 10
add_chain_pdb 1 1L2Y.pdb:1:A,1,20
box_length 125
tmin 200 Kelvin
tmax 400 Kelvin
ntmp 50
ncT 1000
nrt 1000
iconf 1000
ncycles 200000
new_obs Rg rg
new_obs ProteinRMSD bbcb using +BB+CB; struc1 1L2Y.pdb:1:A,2,19 ; struc2 $::A
</pre></div><p>Note how we used a different way to input the sequence. Since we are calculating RMSD, the PDB file is already in the run directory. So, why not extract the sequence form there ?!</p>
<p>You can omit the commands tmin, tmax, ntmp and ncT and provide a schema file with the command "schema_file" in the settings file just like we did on the command line earlier.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tutorial_3_common_error">
A common error</a></h2>
<p>We have often received error reports when the user tries something like this and is puzzled why simulated annealing thinks it has nothing to do. </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
prompt&gt; $profasi_dir/bin/SimAnnealRun -ac 1 "*NLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS*" \
-ncyc 20000 -nrt 500 -tmax "374 Kelvin" -tmin "274 Kelvin" -ntmp 50 -ncT 1000
</pre></div><p>If you look more carefully, we are asking for 50 temperatures and 1000 MC sweeps at each temperature. That requires 50000 sweeps, whereas we have given the program only 20000 sweeps. Simulated annealing only performs an integral number of annealing cycles from maximum to minimum temperature. It calculates the number of annealing cycles it can complete and then adjusts the number of MC cycles to match that. For instance, in the above example, if we had used <em>-ntmp</em> <em>9</em> instead of 50, the standard output would have informed us that the program was trying to get from cycle 0 to 18000 even if we asked for 20000. In the case of the above example, that readjusted MC cycle count becomes 0, and hence, nothing happens.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tutorial_3_parallel">
Running simulated annealing in parallel</a></h2>
<p>You can also run several simulated annealing runs in parallel conveniently by running the binary "SimAnnealRun.mex" (generated if you did a "make parallel" when you compiled PROFASI).</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
prompt&gt; mpirun -np 64 $profasi_dir/bin/SimAnnealRun.mex -ac 1 "*NLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS*" -ncyc 20000 -nrt 500 --schema_file abcd.sas
</pre></div><p>There is no communication between different parallel ranks in simulated annealing. SimAnnealRun.mex is simply a "farming" approach to exploit available computing power in computing clusters to get more annealing cycles quicker. Parallel tempering, covered in a later tutorial, is a genuinely parallel simulation algorithm.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tutorial_3_closing">
Closing remarks</a></h2>
<p>We remind the reader that simulated annealing is a global optimisation method. Often it is useful to find the minimum energy conformation for a given system in a force field, but it is not particularly useful to calculate the temperature dependence of measurable quantities. Even for finding the global minimum of energy in protein systems, if we start with no information about the ground state, our experience indicates that replica exchange or parallel tempering works noticeably better for all but the simplest of peptide systems.</p>
<p>If you use this method, you should make sure that there are a large number of annealing cycles, going from the maximum to the minimum temperature, either by having very long trajectories with many annealing cycles or a large number of runs in parallel.</p>
