<h1><a class="anchor" id="new_features_15">New in PROFASI version 1.5 </a></h1><ul>
<li><b>New default force field</b> The latest published version of our <a href="http://www.pmc.org/2/2">force field</a> which we call <em>FF08</em> inside PROFASI. Outside that context, it should be refered to as <b>Lund FF08</b>. This is the default force field of PROFASI 1.5. </li>
<li><b>PROFASI's XML structure format</b> A new XML structure format for structure output. The XML format stores the degrees of freedom in PROFASI instead of the Cartessian coordinates. In contrast to the older PROFASI textconf format, the XML format contains sequence information. There are XML nodes for each protein, which have sub-nodes corresponding to the residues. Only the residues, instead of being subdivided into atom nodes are represented by the residue names and the degrees of freedom. The XML structure files are much smaller than PDB files for the same system, and contain more accurate information on the protein. The new XML format the recommended format for storing structures and for giving input structures to PROFASI simulations. (<a class="el" href="xmlstruc.html">PROFASI's XML structure file format</a> ) </li>
<li><b>Self timing runs</b>: Normally simulations run on computing clusters where a single run does not have unlimited time. Already the first versions of PROFASI could restart simulations for continuation. PROFASI 1.5 makes it much easier. There is no difference between the settings of a fresh run and a continued run. The simulation programs detect if there are files from a previous run in the same directory. If there are, a continuation is attempted. A fresh run starts in a fresh directory without output files form previous runs. Simulation programs can be told how much time they have for the run. This is the time requested, for instance, from the PBS queue manager. If the simulation does not finish as the end of the allocated time approaches, it "suspends" the run, meaning it saves vital information of a clean continuation and quits. To continue the run, the user just needs to resubmit the job. It continues from where it left. </li>
<li><b>Storage of MC "trajectory" information</b>: In PROFASI 1.1, a file called "conf" used to be generated by the simulation programs (one for each rank), which contained binary snapshots of the state of the population at predetermined intervals. A separate file, "conf.info" provided meta-data with which binary conf files generated in one computer could be translated for another computer of a different architecture. This was the task of the program "conf_to_gzip". Now, translating is not necessary. The binary conf files contain inline headers containing all the necessary meta-data. They can be interpreted even if the reading computer has different byte order or uses more bytes for numbers of a given type than the writing computer. Each restart of a run also produces a specially named (based on the time of the first write during that particular restart) binary conf file. An over-all envelop file in text format, called "traj" stiches these binary files together. Loosely, the "traj" files tell what binary files were generated during the entire history over many restarts, and what ranges of MC cycles they covered. PROFASI post-processing programs such as "extract_snapshot" have been re-written to work with the "traj" files. So, outwardly "traj" seems like what used to be "conf" -- just that it is better. (<a class="el" href="traj_files.html">PROFASI trajectory files</a>) </li>
<li><b>Program for Wang_landau simulations </b> A new experimental simulation program for Wang-Landau simulations is provided. PROFASI Wang-Landau simulations have not been thoroughly tested in research problems. (<a class="el" href="classWLRun.html">WLRun</a>) </li>
<li><b>Multiplexed parallel tempering </b> Parallel tempering in PROFASI 1.5 (<a class="el" href="classParTempRun.html">ParTempRun</a>) has the multiplexing feature built in. The benefits or otherwise of the multiplexing idea for protein simulations are still unclear. The feature is therefore turned off by default. To use multiplexing, use the command "multiplexing on" in the settings file or the command line option --multiplexing for <a class="el" href="classParTempRun.html" title="Parallel tempering class.">ParTempRun</a>. </li>
<li><b> Minimization and regularization </b> While it has always been possible to find approximations to PDB structures in PROFASI by minimizing RMSD, energy or some other property using simulated annealing, PROFASI 1.5 provides dedicated programs for these common tasks. No set up is required for regularization and very little is needed to <a class="el" href="classminimize.html" title="Minimize an expression over degrees of freedom of a protein molecule.">minimize</a> a linear combination of observables. These programs use a mixture of conjugate gradient minimization and Monte Carlo, and are often faster than simulated annealing in arriving at "an" answer. But it is likely that the minimum found in simulated annealing will have lower function values. (<a class="el" href="regul.html">Regularization: approximating a protein structure</a>, <a class="el" href="classminimize.html" title="Minimize an expression over degrees of freedom of a protein molecule.">minimize</a>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>XML templates</b> PROFASI 1.5 uses XML extensively, and contains a module for XML processing. The purpose of the module is internal use inside PROFASI and to keep PROFASI self-contained. The XML module in PROFASI, we emphasize, is not even meant to serve for the most general possible use of XML. It contains non-standard conveniences to keep PROFASI XML files smaller. One of these is what we call <a href="xml__templates.html">XML templates</a>, which allows files containing tabular data to be interpreted as a sequence of XML nodes of identical structure. (<a class="el" href="xml_templates.html">XML templates: Auto-generate complex XML nodes from tabular data</a>)</li>
