Simple program to take a sequence of three or more amino acids and
dump a pdb file where the chain is completely stretched. This is
useful to check the geometrical parameters of different groups in
PROFASi, but also if one needs a quick pdb file of a single residue.

To compile, type make.

Usage example:

geometry.ex "GLY LYS GLY" -o lys.pdb

Note: The minimum sequence length that works is 3. So, if you are
just interested in the geometry of Lysine, please two Glycine 
residues as padding on both sides.
