This directory contains a bare-bones program that runs a simple Markov
Chain Monte Carlo simulation using PROFASI. The sequence and the
temperature are adjustible from the command line, as are the variables
such as length of the simulation, frequency of writes ... Use the 
program without an argument to see a short list of option, and with
"--help" for a more detailed description. 

To compile, type make.
